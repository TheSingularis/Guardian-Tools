# 1. What

## 1.1 Motivation

As someone who has played Destiny since release through Destiny 2 now, I often use web based tools outside of the game to simplify inventory management and managing tasks. For a time now I have wanted to make a custom tool to bring together multiple tools I like to use into one application.

## 1.2 Goals

I want to make one tool that brings together ---Inventory Management---, ---Triumph Tracking---, ---Seasonal Challenges---, ---Powerful / Pinnacle Gear Tracking---, and more...
