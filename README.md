# 1. GuardianTools

As someone who has played Destiny since release through Destiny 2 now, I often use web based tools outside of the game to simplify inventory management and managing tasks. For a time now I have wanted to make a custom tool to bring together multiple tools I like to use into one application.

# 2. Installation

## 2.1 Download

## 2.2 Pip requirements.txt

## 2.3 Gen auth files

## 2.4 Profit?

# 3. Todo

## 3.1 Easy

- [ ] Text replacement
  - [ ] Get a new font file from the game files
    - [ ] Trace Rifles
  - [ ] Optimize the process by running the whole thing once instead of the entire page once for each of the symbols

  ## 3.2 Medium

- [ ] Design a dashboard page
  - [ ] Figure out what basics to display, probably weekly progress and vendor ranks and character light and other stats
- [ ] Type up info for installing a dev build yourself

## 3.3 Hard

- [ ] Seasonal Challenges
  - [ ] Finalize the design for the challenges pages    
    - [ ] Implement separating the challenges by activity, i.e. Strikes, Crucible, Gambit, Quests
  - [ ] Add previous Seasons that are still shown in game, pending changes come Witch Queen removing previous seasons
  - [ ] Remove hard coded getters for the seasonal challenges from the API in favor of dynamic searches to future proof the system and prevent having to manually change it come a new season

# 4. Issues
