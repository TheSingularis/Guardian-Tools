# 1. GuardianTools

As someone who has played Destiny since release through Destiny 2 now, I often use web based tools outside of the game to simplify inventory management and managing tasks. For a time now I have wanted to make a custom tool to bring together multiple tools I like to use into one application.

# 3. Todo

- [ ] Design a dashboard page
  - [ ] Figure out what basics to display, probably weekly progress and vendor ranks and character light and other stats
- [ ] Seasonal Challenges
  - [ ] Finalize the design for the challenges pages    
    - [ ] Implement separating the challenges by activity, i.e. Strikes, Crucible, Gambit, Quests
  - [ ] Add previous Seasons that are still shown in game, pending changes come Witch Queen removing previous seasons
  - [ ] Remove hard coded getters for the seasonal challenges from the API in favor of dynamic searches to future proof the system and prevent having to manually change it come a new season
- [ ] Type up info for installing a dev build yourself
